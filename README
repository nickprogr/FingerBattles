This game was created as a Semester Project for the course of Human-Computer Interaction.

We do not own any licence on this game. The idea, all the rules, the gameplay
and most of the images had been given to all the course students.

We do not make any profit from this application. It is not, and it will never be uploaded
to the Android Market, in this form and concept.
